# Sentence Transformer

This project demonstrates sentence transformers for natural language processing tasks.

## Overview

The `transformer.ipynb` notebook contains implementations and examples of using transformer models to encode sentences into dense vector representations.

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:
- `sentence-transformers`
- `scipy`
- `numpy`

## Usage

1. Install requirements (see above)
2. Open and run `transformer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow the notebook cells to:
    - Load pre-trained sentence transformer models
    - Encode sentences into embeddings
    - Perform similarity comparisons
    - Evaluate model performance

## Output

The notebook generates sentence embeddings and demonstrates semantic similarity calculations between text inputs.
